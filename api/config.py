"""API config — the data layer, laid out along the cloud/local boundary (2026-08-23).

`data/cloud/` is the literal migration unit — everything under it goes to production
(CLOUD_DATA_MODEL.md §0.5). Two seams live under it, kept strictly apart (§0):

  DATA_DIR    — Bucket A-serve: shared, read-only CONTENT the runtime reads (chapter
                mappings, framework glossaries/spine map, allocation norms, saved plans =
                canonical libraries + served-plan cache). Default:
                aruvi-saas/data/cloud/content/. Env override: ARUVI_DATA_DIR.
                The cloud object store replaces this.

  STATE_DIR   — Bucket B: per-user / per-tenant STATE the app writes at runtime
                (accounts, academic years, readiness, allocations, section state,
                prepared plans, plan archive, plan notes). Default:
                aruvi-saas/data/cloud/state/. Env override: ARUVI_STATE_DIR.
                Supabase Postgres replaces this folder.

  TESTING_DIR — the founder's testing-campaign state (api/testing_campaign.py).
                LOCAL-only, never syncs; deliberately outside data/cloud/. Default:
                aruvi-saas/data/testing/. Env override: ARUVI_TESTING_DIR.

Founder-secure authoring content (constitutions, chapter summaries) lives at
data/authoring/ and is read ONLY by the genon pipeline / chapter skill — never from
api/ or aruvi_core/ (§0.5's grep-able invariant). Paths are derived from this file's
location (never hardcoded to a machine); env vars override for other layouts.

# rate that happens to be zero rather than a seller who does not charge it. The day
# registration happens: set ARUVI_GSTIN (and ARUVI_TAX_RATE, a percentage) and the
# document grows its tax rows. TAX_INCLUSIVE says whether PRICE_PER_SUBJECT_STAGE

#   · the TEACHER's academic year  — AcademicYear/{year_id}, per teacher, Bucket B,
#     the year she is TEACHING in. Step 1 scopes her state by it.
#   · the LIBRARY's year (this)    — which authored edition a lesson plan came from,
#     Bucket A, the same for everybody.
#
# They are independent: a teacher can teach one 2026-27 plan for several years running,
# and two teachers in different years can be served the same edition. My Lessons already
# shows her PRIOR-YEAR FOLDER — that is her year, not the plan's, and once a second
# edition exists, showing one while she assumes the other is exactly the confusion the
# stamp is for.
#
# LP_YEAR is the edition CURRENTLY BEING SERVED: the folder new generation reads from and
# writes into (saved_plans/{subject}/{grade}/{LP_YEAR}/), and the value stamped into every
# canonical's genon_canonical block. Bump it when a new edition is published — the January
# re-authoring batch (§2.1: the new canonicals must exist by roughly January, before the
# March–June peak).
#
# ★ The stamp is a LABEL, never a cache key. Derived plans stay keyed by
# (engine, constitution-run) — see data.genon_plan_filename. That is what lets a carried
# chapter keep its whole variant cache across an edition bump instead of re-paying to
# regenerate content that did not change. aruvi-scripts/carry_over_year.py copies the
# canonical AND its derived plans, rewriting only this field. Put the year in the key and
# you buy the entire library again every June, at peak load.
