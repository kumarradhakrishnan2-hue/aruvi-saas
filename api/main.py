"""
Aruvi API — the bridge between the web frontend and the Python engine.

Wraps the engine's three jobs over HTTP:
  - Allocate  : distribute a period budget across a subject's chapters (live, no LLM)
  - My Plans  : list saved plans, and serve any plan translated into the canonical view model
  - Generate  : stubbed for now (live generation deferred)

Importing the subject packages registers all five plugins with the engine registry.
Data comes from local disk (api/data.py) for now; live generation and the DB come later.
