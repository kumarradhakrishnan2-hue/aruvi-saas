"""The Ask Aruvi question bank — ONE file, signed-in only, cached on the device (2026-08-30).

Run: python3 tests/test_ask_aruvi_kb.py

★ THE ONE THING THESE TESTS EXIST TO PROTECT.

The bank is hand-written and lives in exactly ONE place:

    data/cloud/content/ask_aruvi/qa_knowledge_base.json   ← the file you edit

`GET /ask-aruvi` serves it from there, behind X-Aruvi-User, and the client caches it in
localStorage so the help screen still works offline (web/app/ask-aruvi/bank.js).

It used to ALSO be copied into web/app/ask-aruvi/ and imported at build time — which compiled
all 120 answers into the main page chunk, a PUBLIC url served before sign-in. The bank states
how period allocation is weighted and how each subject's assessment is built; that is founder
IP, and it was downloadable by any crawler in machine-readable form.
`test_bank_is_not_bundled` is what stops that returning: it is the security guard of this
file, not a tidiness check. If someone re-adds the import for convenience, the exposure comes
back silently and nothing else would notice.

`test_index_is_current` guards the other half. Keywords are tf-idf derived and score 3 against
a query where the question scores 2 and the answer 1, so they are what make a teacher's own
word reach the right pair. They are corpus-relative: editing ONE pair shifts the ranking for
every other. A hand-edit that skips the re-index leaves the bank looking correct and searching
worse. Fixed by: python3 aruvi-scripts/sync_ask_aruvi.py

★ ON test_teacher_words_reach_their_pair.

It mirrors askAruviSearch.js and asserts that a set of realistic teacher phrasings land on the
intended pair. Eight of these failed when the 2026-08-30 batch was first written — "rename"
appeared nowhere in the sections pair, "support" nowhere in its question, "cost" nowhere at all
— and the wording was changed until they landed. If you reword a pair and this test fails, the
finding is real: a teacher's word no longer reaches that answer. **Fix the wording, not the
test** — or, if the question genuinely no longer covers that phrasing, move the expectation to
the pair that now does.
