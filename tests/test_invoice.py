"""
Tests for invoicing (2026-08-26): a purchase produces a numbered invoice, stored under
her account, attached to the confirmation mail and downloadable from the subscription
page.

The properties worth pinning are the ones that are expensive to discover later: the
number series must be gapless and per financial year, the stored PDF must be the bytes
that were sent (never a re-render), one teacher must not reach another's invoice, and a
failure to render must not cost her the subscription she paid for.

Run standalone:  python3 tests/test_invoice.py     (also pytest-compatible)
