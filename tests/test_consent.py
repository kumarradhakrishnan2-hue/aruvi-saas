"""
Tests for the user agreement's six ticks (2026-08-27).

What is under test, in the order it matters:

  1. THE DOCUMENT PARSES. `api/legal.py` cuts the founder's markdown into five
     acknowledgements + the full agreement + the final tick. A consent screen missing a
     tick is the kind of bug nobody notices, so a malformed document must raise rather
     than serve half of itself.
  2. THE RECORD IS APPEND-ONLY AND TENANT-KEYED, and it survives an ERASE — deliberately,
     because proof the other party can delete is not proof (founder, 2026-08-27).
  3. THE GATE. No checkout without an acceptance of the CURRENT version; a partial
     acceptance is refused rather than stored.

Run standalone:  python3 tests/test_consent.py     (also pytest-compatible)

      * the ROW survives — every other Bucket-B store is walked destructively, this one
        is not, and the receipt says so;
      * the SIGNATURE does not — erase stamps `superseded_at`, so the returning id is

    came back, and walked straight past the agreement because the kept row still
