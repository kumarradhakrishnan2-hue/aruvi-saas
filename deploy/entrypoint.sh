# Container entrypoint (Track A). Two jobs, then uvicorn.
#
# 1. SEED THE SELLER-SIDE SERIES onto an empty disk. The invoice counter
#    (invoices/_series/), the support reference counter (support/_series/) and the consent
#    ledger (consents/_ledger/) are deliberately outside the {kind}/{tenant}/{user} shape
#    so erasure can't reach them — and for the same reason a brand-new disk has none of
#    them. Numbering must CONTINUE (MEY/2026-27/7864…, MEY-S-…), not restart, so each is
#    copied from the image's seed exactly once: only when that path is absent on the disk.
#    Teacher state is never seeded — a production disk starts with no teachers.
#
# 2. Say out loud where state lives and whether mail will send (dev.sh's habit).
