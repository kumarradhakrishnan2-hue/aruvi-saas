Adapter ports — the seams that keep Aruvi free of vendor lock-in.

Core logic depends only on these abstract Protocols; each vendor (Anthropic, Supabase,
Upstash, Razorpay, ...) is a thin adapter implementing one of them, wired in at the edge.
Swapping a provider = write one adapter, never touch the engine or app. This is the same
pattern the prototype's `llm_client.py` already proved, applied across the board.

    ★ EXTENDED 2026-08-29 with `list_prefix` and `exists`, and the reason is the
    whole point of the port. The original three methods addressed a single object by
    name, which is all a generated PDF ever needs. But the runtime does not only read
    files it can name — it asks "which chapters exist?", "which canonicals are in this
    chapter's library?", "which editions have been published?" and reads everything it
    finds. Without a listing method those questions could only be answered by going
    around the port to the filesystem, which is exactly what api/data.py did.

    ★ PATHS ARE KEYS, NOT FILESYSTEM PATHS. Every method takes a '/'-joined path
    RELATIVE to the content root, and no adapter may treat a path component as a
    directory that must exist. `list_prefix` is therefore prefix-matching, not
    directory-listing: an object store has no directories, only keys that happen to
    share a leading substring. A local adapter maps prefixes onto folders because it
    can; an S3 adapter never needs to. This is the one design choice that decides
    whether the port survives contact with a real object store.

    Ordering is part of the contract: `list_prefix` returns results SORTED, because
    callers rely on a stable read order for the library (a plan's units and a
    chapter's canonicals are read in name order and served in the order read)."""

# ── Plan archive ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A teacher can ARCHIVE a lesson plan from My Lessons to declutter without ever losing it
# (there is deliberately NO hard delete — plans carry real generation cost, and the teacher-
# specific state around them — the LU pointer, notes, section attachments — is irreplaceable;
# the design decision, 2026-07-04). Archive is a per-tenant FLAG, not a physical move: the
# plan asset itself is shared read-only CONTENT under DATA_DIR (Bucket A), so archiving cannot
# relocate it. Instead we record the plan's key `{subject}/{grade}/{filename}` in this Bucket-B
# store; My Lessons lists un-archived plans, an Archived view lists the rest, and Restore just
# drops the key. Frozen identity + all back-references = restore is lossless. A plan being
# actively taught (any section attached) is blocked from archiving in the UI, so archived plans
# are only ever detached ones.
#
# Keyed by tenant_id + user_id (auth stubbed → tenant_id == user_id today). A Supabase adapter
# (an `archived_at` column on the plan row, or a small `plan_archive` table) swaps in behind
# this same port at Phase 4 with no change to the API routes or the React components.
