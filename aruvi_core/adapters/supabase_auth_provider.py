"""AuthProvider adapter for Supabase Auth — the credential is a Supabase-issued JWT.

Track B of docs/mobile_migration_plan.md (2026-09-09). The client (web or the Expo app)
signs in with supabase-js — `signInWithOtp({phone})` → `verifyOtp` — and from then on
sends the session's access token as `Authorization: Bearer …`. THIS class verifies that
token offline: signature, expiry, audience and issuer, with no call to Supabase per
request. `api/main.py:_current_identity()` remains the single caller.

★ THE IDENTITY IS STILL THE MOBILE. Supabase's stable subject (`sub`) is a UUID, but
every contract in this product — `/onboarding/known?id=`, the email→mobile resolution,
the invoice, the consent ledger, the per-user localStorage keys — is keyed by the
10-digit number, and the front door's own header says "mobile IS the identity". So the
user_id (== tenant_id) is derived from the token's verified `phone` claim, E.164 without
the plus ("919876543210"), reduced to the 10-digit national number the rest of the
product already speaks. A token without a phone claim (an email-only Supabase user)
is refused: there is no identity to run under. Consequence to remember: a teacher who
changes her number is a new account — Supabase's phone-change flow stays OFF in the
beta. Flipping to `sub` as the key is one line in `identity_from_claims`, deliberately
kept as a separate function so that decision is visible and testable.

Verification supports both key styles Supabase issues: the project's asymmetric signing
keys (ES256/RS256, fetched and cached from the JWKS endpoint) and the legacy shared
HS256 secret (`jwt_secret`; also what the tests use, so they need no network).
