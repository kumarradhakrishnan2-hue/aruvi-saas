"""SupportRepository over the document backend (file or Postgres — Track C, 2026-09-09).

Layout, under ARUVI_STATE_DIR:

    support/{tenant}/{user}/ARV-S-742.json     the request, as she wrote it
    support/_series/support.json               the reference counter

The two placements are deliberate and opposite:

**The request is HERS.** It is her words, filed under her identity, so the erase
traversal reaches it by folder boundary like every other Bucket-B store, and the data
export renders it. A teacher who asks for everything Aruvi holds about her and is not
shown the messages she sent has not been shown everything.

**The counter is the SELLER'S.** It sits in `support/_series/`, outside any tenant
folder — the invoice-series precedent (`_slug` strips the leading underscore, so no
tenant can ever collide with it). If it lived inside a teacher's folder her erasure
would take it with her and the next teacher would be handed a reference already in use.
The counter holds one integer and nothing about anybody.

References are short on purpose: they are quoted in email subject lines and read aloud.
No financial year, no zero padding — a case belongs to the day it was raised, not to a
book that has to balance, and 742 → 1000 is a counter growing, not a format breaking.
