"""ManualBillingProvider — the founder IS the gateway (Step 5 reference impl).

Implements the BillingProvider port with no vendor: create_subscription writes an
active entitlement, cancel expires it, fetch_status reads it. Real behaviour — grant,
expire, revoke — exercised via aruvi-scripts/entitlement.py, so the subscription
machinery is testable end-to-end before any gateway exists. The partner's Razorpay /
Play Billing / Apple IAP adapters replace THIS CLASS behind the same port and populate
Entitlement.source with the real platform of purchase; nothing above the port changes.

verify_webhook raises: there is no webhook when the founder is the gateway, and a
silent success here would mask a mis-wired gateway integration later.

        already holds are kept, and each scope carries ITS OWN expiry (a subject added
