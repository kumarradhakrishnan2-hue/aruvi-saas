"""generate_canonical.py — one CLI for canonical LP+assessment generation.

Sync mode (this version — HANDOVER step-4 execution design):

    python3 generate_canonical.py one <subject> <grade> <chapter> [options]

    e.g.  python3 generate_canonical.py one social_sciences ix 5
          python3 generate_canonical.py one social_sciences ix 5 --dry
          python3 generate_canonical.py one social_sciences ix 5 \

              --tag control_v10        # the v1.0 control test

Prompt assembly is delegated ENTIRELY to prompt_assembly.py (the verbatim
prototype wrapper) — this file only resolves inputs, makes the API call,
validates, saves, and logs. Batch mode (Message Batches API, 50% discount)
is deliberately deferred until the mass pre-warm sweep.

Defaults per the genon master plan:
- duration  = class-standard (40 ≤ VII, 45 VIII, 50 IX)
- period count = recommended_periods from genon/master_plan.json
- model = the certified generation model (claude-sonnet-4-6, thinking off —
  llm_client.py's certified baseline)

Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in the environment for live runs (never --dry).

    naked inner quotes (below) and, since 2026-08-17, the one-character wrong
    closer (`_bracket_fix` above — tried first, because the quote heuristic
    corrupts on it).

    Returns `(parsed | None, problems, repairs)`.

    THE (first) GLITCH: naked (unescaped) double quotes inside a JSON string. Each repair
    escapes exactly ONE quote pair — provably content-neutral, no character is added or
    removed except the two backslashes — and every repair is recorded so the ledger can
    report it. Any OTHER defect still fails hard: nothing else is auto-touched.

    THE BOUND WAS 10, AND 10 WAS THE WRONG ORDER OF MAGNITUDE (2026-08-11, S8's C1).
    It was set when the glitch looked like a rare slip (4 quotes, 2026-07-26). It is not
    rare on the stages whose LP constitution MANDATES an inner-quoted band narration:
    mathematics preparatory Rule 6 and mathematics middle Rule 10 both require
    `book_ref ("description....")`, so nearly every band that invokes a textbook task
    carries a quote pair — 45 of 62 bands in maths III ch 5's standard canonical.

    Escaping is left to the model and is NOT reliable, and the failure is a whole-run
    MODE rather than a scatter: ch 5's standard escaped all 45 of its pairs and parsed
    clean; its 11-period compact escaped none of its 42 and died at the 10th repair with
    ₹40.72 already spent. So the bound must clear the worst case a COMPLIANT plan can
    present (a long chapter at ~5 bands/unit ≈ 100), not the best. Each iteration is one
    pass over ~100 KB, so the headroom costs milliseconds.

    `MAX_REPAIR_SPAN` is the other magic number here and it is deliberately left as is:
    a "pair" wider than 300 characters is more likely a genuinely broken structure than a
    quoted phrase, and repairing it would corrupt rather than rescue. Measured on the run
    that motivated this: max span 159, median 83, none above 300.

    # ── PURGE THE DERIVED PLANS (2026-08-12, S11 · C10, ARV-D-137) ───────────────────
    # A canonical that changes invalidates every served plan built from it, and until now
    # only the REPAIR tools said so: `purge_derived` was wired into normalize_options,
    # repair_register, repair_anchors, repair_leaked_deliberation and repair_item_type —
    # every repair, and no generator.
    #
    # The reasoning that left the generator out was that regenerating mints a new
    # `ledger_ts`, so the cache key moves and no stale file can be hit
    # (`api/data.canonical_version`). That holds for the CHOSEN variant and fails for a
    # LENDER: a served plan can carry a unit BORROWED from another canonical, and the key
    # names only the variant that was served. Measured at S11's C10 after the top was
    # re-authored to remove ARV-D-136 — the X=11 and X=15 plans key on p10 and p14, whose
    # versions did not move, so both would have been served from cache still carrying the
    # withdrawn synthesis text: the two serves the re-author existed to fix.
    #
    # Same remedy as every repair tool, for the same reason, and the cost is the one
    # already accepted in purge_derived's own header — a teacher holding a purged plan
    # loses that file and re-prepares in ~11 ms. Deliberately unconditional: working out
    # whether THIS canonical lends to any existing plan means reading every derived file
    # and re-running the choice set, which is more machinery than deleting cheap artefacts.

# ── THE TWO HALVES OF A GENERATION, EXTRACTED (2026-08-12, for the batch path) ──
# `cmd_one` used to be one block: build the prompt, call the model, post-process the
# answer. The Message Batches path needs the FIRST and THIRD halves and replaces only
# the middle (one async submit for many chapters instead of one blocking stream), so the
# two halves are functions now and `cmd_one` is their first caller. Nothing about the
# sync path's behaviour changes — this is a move, not a rewrite. The alternative was a
# second copy of the parse/validate/install/log sequence in the batch script, which is
# the 2026-08-11 lesson ("two copies of a heuristic are one bug waiting") applied to the
# one code path where the bug would be a silently mis-installed paid artefact.
