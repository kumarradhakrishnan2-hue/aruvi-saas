"""batch_build.py — run build_library.py across a whole subject·stage, resumably (v1.0, 2026-08-12).

    python3 genon/batch_build.py the_world_around_us v iv iii            # the S5 corpus
    python3 genon/batch_build.py the_world_around_us v --chapters 1-4,7  # a slice
    python3 genon/batch_build.py the_world_around_us v iv iii --plan     # price it, spend nothing

WHY THIS EXISTS. `build_library.py` builds ONE chapter and is already resumable and
idempotent — it skips any canonical already on disk, so a failure never re-buys a paid
file. What it does not do is decide WHICH chapters, keep the per-chapter logs apart, price
the run before it starts, or stop when a stage-wide defect is burning money one chapter at a
time. A shell `for` loop does the first and none of the rest. At 90 runs for TWAU alone
(≈ ₹2.8k) those four are the difference between a batch you can read afterwards and a bill.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, deliberately:
  * it never authors anything itself — every metered call is `build_library.py`'s, unchanged,
    one subprocess per chapter (the 2026-08-11 lesson: a second copy of a paid code path is
    the original bug waiting to come back);
  * it never certifies and never approves. Each chapter's certification report is written by
    `build_library.py` where it always was (`genon/out/library_reports/`); the HUMAN GATE is
    unchanged and still the founder's, at whatever sampling rate is chosen. This script's
    summary tells you which reports to open, not what they say.

RESUME. Re-running is the resume: a chapter whose library is complete on disk is skipped
before the subprocess starts, so an interrupted batch continues where it stopped. `--redo`
forces regeneration (passed straight through), `--certify-only` re-runs only the free steps
across the worklist — the cheap way to re-certify a whole stage after an engine or gate change.

STOPPING. `--max-fails N` (default 2) aborts the batch after N chapters fail. A one-off
generation defect should not end an overnight run; a systematic one should not be paid for
thirty-one times.

NETWORK DROPS AUTO-RESUME (v1.1, 2026-08-12). The SDK retries a dropped connection only a
couple of times, seconds apart, and a streamed generation cannot be resumed mid-flight — so a
three-minute outage kills the run in progress AND, without this, the next chapters in the
worklist, each failing in seconds until `--max-fails` aborts a batch the network was about to
come back for. So: when a chapter fails, its log is classified. TRANSIENT (connection reset,
timeout, DNS, 429/500/502/503/529 overloaded) → wait for `api.anthropic.com` to answer again,
then re-run the SAME chapter, up to `--net-retries` times, NOT counted against `--max-fails`.
Anything else — a validation failure, a certification failure, a bad key — is a DEFECT and is
never retried: retrying a defect is how you pay twice for the same mistake.

Re-running is safe because `build_library.py` skips canonicals already on disk, so a retry
resumes at the file the outage interrupted. What it cannot recover is the in-flight generation
itself: if the stream died after the model had produced its output, that run is billed and
there is no file, so the retry re-buys it (~₹31). That is the whole cost of an outage.

FLAGS: --plan (print the worklist + estimate, spend nothing) · --yes (skip the confirm) ·
--top-only / --certify-only / --redo (passed through per chapter) · --chapters 1-4,7 (single
grade only) · --max-fails N · --rate R (₹ per authoring run for the estimate, default 31) ·
--net-retries N (default 3) · --net-wait S (seconds to wait for the network per retry,
default 1800) · --no-net-retry (treat every failure as a defect).
