"""repair_register.py — backfill register breaches in an authored library (v1.0, 2026-08-02).

FOUNDER RULING, 2026-08-02: regenerating is a lottery. The SS·IX ch 3 top canonical breached
THE SELF-CONTAINED REGISTER nine times while authored under v1.10, which bans it in terms;
another run samples the same distribution at Rs 39 with no guarantee. So breaches are repaired
in place — and the doctrine that "fixes happen upstream, never by hand-editing artifacts" is
honoured by making the repair a PIPELINE STAGE rather than a text editor session: the edits are
declared here in code, applied by assertion, recorded in the artefact, and re-scanned.

WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE, and the line it must not cross:
  * every edit is a STATED (old -> new) pair, not a generated rewrite. No model authors text
    here. If `old` is not found verbatim the file is left untouched and the run fails loudly —
    so a repair can never silently drift against a regenerated artefact.
  * almost every edit is a DELETION of a trailing clause (the breaches are appositives:
    "— a thread to pick up in the climate-change unit"). Nothing is invented.
  * the artefact records what was done, in genon_canonical.repairs[], so corpus statistics can
    still tell generation quality from repair quality. Without that record we would lose the
    evidence that says whether to change the MECHANISM instead of repairing forever.
  * STRUCTURAL and PEDAGOGICAL defects are OUT OF SCOPE and must stay out: a cross-unit
    materials dependency, approach-diversity repeats, an anchor that names the wrong section.
    Repairing those here would launder content changes as text hygiene. They go to the human
    gate or a regeneration decision.

    python3 genon/repair_register.py --list                        # show the declared edits
    python3 genon/repair_register.py --apply                       # back up, apply, record, re-scan
    python3 genon/repair_register.py --grade ix --list             # an older stage's set

v1.3, 2026-08-04: the library path is no longer hard-coded to social_sciences/ix — the tool
takes --subject/--grade and selects the matching declaration set, because S2 needed it. Each
set is keyed by (subject, grade) and is stale by design once applied: re-running an applied set
FAILS its own "declared text not found" assertion, which is the guard, not a bug.

# DECLARATIONS REWRITTEN 2026-08-03 (v1.1). The previous set was written against the
# 2026-08-01 library (12/9/7) and went stale the moment that library was regenerated under
# LP v1.10 / assessment v1.6 on 2026-08-03 (12/10/7) — `--list` failed its own assertion on
# the very first edit, which is the guard working exactly as designed. The p09 variant no
# longer exists; p07 now scans clean. What follows is declared against the CURRENT artefacts
# (ch_03_canonical.json 14:19, ch_03_canonical_p10.json 14:34, ch_03_canonical_p07.json 14:34)
# and covers the four surviving breaches in the 2026-08-03 certification report.
#
# Three of the four are the SAME family: a clock quantity written into band prose when the
# band already carries its own `minutes`. Those are pure deletions of the quantity — the
# activity, the grouping and the output all stand. The fourth is a forward reference.
# ── v1.2 ADDITIONS, 2026-08-03 (ARV-D-026) ──────────────────────────────────────
# Four breaches found at C3 that the 18:07 pass never saw, because register_scan had no
# pattern for their phrasing: a RANGED clock quantity ("for two to three minutes" — the
# scanner matches "for two minutes") and three forward references in prose the pattern list
# did not cover. The patterns are added to register_scan.py in the same change, so the next
# library is gated on them rather than found by hand. The p10 U1 "the three functions the
# whole chapter unpacks" borderline is deliberately NOT repaired (founder ruling, same day):
# read as orienting prose about the chapter as an object, not a pointer to a later unit.
#
# ── v1.3, 2026-08-04 · S2 · social_sciences VIII ch 3 "The Rise of the Marathas" ──
# Seven breaches in the 16:37 certification report — 3 forward references, 4 clock quantities,
# across the standard canonical (6) and p10 (1); p13 scanned clean.
#
# WHY THIS LIBRARY BREACHED, and why repair is the founder's call rather than the obvious one:
# the artefact records `constitution: LP v2.7 / assessment v2.3`. It was authored at 16:10-16:37,
# BEFORE the stage's P1-P4 amendments landed at 17:39 — so it was generated against a
# constitution that did not contain THE SELF-CONTAINED REGISTER at all. The model was never told
# the three bans. That makes this NOT the 2026-08-02 lottery case (SS·IX breached a register its
# constitution stated in terms); a run under v2.8 would have been the first roll with the rule
# present. FOUNDER RULING 2026-08-04: repair now, do not regenerate — ~Rs 150 and the ordering
# breach is recorded as a waiver instead. Consequence carried forward: the v2.8 register block
# enters the campaign never having been GENERATED against, and is owed a live check at the
# corpus pre-warm (MEMORY.md "AMENDMENTS TO BE TESTED").
#
# All seven are pure deletions. Nothing is rewritten and no clause is replaced with new text:
# three trailing forward-reference appositives go whole, and four clock quantities are struck
# from sentences that read correctly without them ("for four minutes" -> ""), which is exactly
# what the register asks for — the band already carries its own `minutes`, and the platform
# rescales them.
