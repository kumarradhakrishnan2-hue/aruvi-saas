"""build_library.py — ONE Terminal command builds a chapter's whole variant library.

    python3 genon/build_library.py social_sciences ix 3

Why Terminal: the Cowork sandbox proxy blocks credentialed API calls in every mode
(proven 2026-08-01 — an x-api-key request never leaves the sandbox), so the metered
Sonnet-4.6 generations must run here, where runtime_data/anthropic.key works.
Everything deterministic runs here too, so the whole mechanical pipeline is one
command; the Cowork session's job is what remains — reading the certification
report at the human gate.

Steps (stops on the first failure; each is idempotent to re-run):
  1. top canonical (LP + assessment)          — generate_canonical.py, metered
  2. annotate master_plan.json                — variant_plans.py (row finalizes)
  3. variant briefs                            — written to genon/out/briefs/
  4. each compact variant (LP + assessment)    — generate_canonical.py --variant, metered
  5. re-annotate                               — variant_plans.py on the full library
  6. arrange MCQ options                       — normalize_options.py (deterministic, free,
     idempotent; option text and is_correct untouched — order, labels and guide keys only)
  7. DETERMINISTIC CERTIFICATION               — compile, registry/first-visit/synthesis
     checks, register scan, MCQ arrangement gate, serve sweep
  8. report                                    — genon/out/library_reports/ch_NN_<ts>.md
     (the Cowork session presents this at the human gate; approval is the
     founder's, never this script's)

    --certify-only   skip generations; run steps 2-8 on whatever library exists
    --redo           regenerate metered artefacts even if they are already on disk

RESUMABLE (2026-08-07): steps 1 and 4 SKIP any canonical already installed, so a build
that failed after paying for a file resumes instead of buying it again. --redo overrides.

# assessment constitution names it `item_stem`** at all three stages, and reading only the
# first quarantined a clean english library on the day the shape gate landed.
#
# ★ `prompt` ADDED 2026-08-13, AND THE COMMENT IT REPLACES WAS FACTUALLY WRONG. It read:
# "`prompt` appears 471 times in the PROTOTYPE-era maths corpus and in no canonical, so it
# is recorded here and deliberately not read: a gate should tolerate the shapes that exist,
# not the shapes that might." It is the stem field of **mathematics·preparatory and
# mathematics·middle** — 123 items across every canonical on disk — so the gate failed 30-33
# items per file and QUARANTINED the whole maths·iii ch 5 library, three paid canonicals,
# on a routine `--certify-only`. The 2026-08-12 census that produced the tuple cannot have
# read the maths family; the one that produced this line did, and is reproducible:
#
#   question_text 1772 (SS · TWAU · science · maths·ix) · prompt 123 (maths·iii, maths·vii)
#   · item_stem 96 (english, all three stages)
#
# The lesson is the one the old comment was reaching for and got backwards: a gate must
# tolerate the shapes that EXIST, and "exists" is settled by a census that covers every
# stage — not by one that stops at the subjects you happened to open. Note maths is diverse
# WITHIN itself (secondary parts company with its own middle and preparatory), which is why
# a subject-level check would have missed it too.

# instead of lines.append(), once the founder prices the rate.
#

    # ("Introduction to the Atmosphere"), and merges and renames are legitimate.

    # It does NOT quarantine — the register-gate precedent. The library serves perfectly

    # ── HANDOFF ↔ ANCHOR AGREEMENT (2026-08-08, S4 · maths·IX ch 4) ───────────────
    # Added because nothing compared the two objects that BETWEEN them decide where an
    # assessment item lands. Checks 3-5 above test a unit's `section_anchor` against the
    # REGISTRY; nothing tested it against the `coverage_handoff`, which on a derived-anchor
    # stage is the item's only route to a unit. maths·IX ch 4's top canonical passed every
    # existing check while units 10-12 wore the `4.1` label and section 1's handoff row
    # listed only unit 1.
    #
    # THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC, and this is the whole design of the check.
    # Measured on that library before writing it (founder ruling 2026-08-08):
    #
    #   handoff lists a unit that does NOT anchor its section  ->  GATE. The item is routed
    #       to a sitting that never taught its section. There is no reading on which that is
    #       correct, and the item cannot be trusted.
    #
    #   a unit anchors a section the handoff does not route through  ->  ADVISORY, never a
    #       gate. The obvious "fix" — extend period_numbers to every unit bearing the label —
    #       was tried and LOSES QUESTIONS: an item anchors at its section's LAST unit, so
    #       extending sec#1 from [1] to [1,10,11,12] moved the Introduction item to unit 12
    #       and it vanished at X=12 (12 items -> 11). p11, which does list them, drops its
    #       Introduction item at X=9 and X=10 for exactly this reason. The shorter list is
    #       the truthful one: section 4.1 completes at unit 1, and consolidation units that
    #       revisit it do not re-open it.
    #
    # So the advisory is the honest signal: a unit wearing a section's label without teaching
    # it. Its real cause is architectural — the registry offers no token for a CONSOLIDATION
    # unit (`synthesis` is reserved to one closing unit), so a chapter with many more units
    # than sections has no legal label for the rest and the model picks the least-wrong
    # registry entry. Read the count; do not "repair" it into a gate pass.

    # ── ITEM-SHAPE GATES (2026-08-12, ARV-D-123 — found at S5's C3) ──────────────
    # Two checks, both free, both closing the same hole: NOTHING IN THE PIPELINE READS AN
    # ITEM'S OWN FIELDS. The certifier checks structure, STEP 6 checks option order, and
    # `verified` is the model's claim about itself. That is how S4 shipped a wrong answer
    # (ARV-D-084) and how S5 shipped `question_type: "HI"` with `question_text: null`
    # (ARV-D-120) — both through a green certification, both found by eye.
    #
    # (1) THE TAXONOMY IS CLOSED, SO CHECK IT. Every assessment constitution names a closed
    #     set and prohibits anything outside it. S5's breach has a cause that will recur on
    #     every stage: the type-selection rule is a TABLE whose left column is some other
    #     enumeration (TWAU's `dominant_mode`, science's mode, SS's weight tier) and whose
    #     right column is the type. A model that copies the left column emits a value that
    #     looks like data because it IS data — just the wrong column. No amount of prose
    #     stops that; a membership test does.
    #
    #     TWO CHECKS, AND ONLY THE FIRST GATES — because the gate quarantines, and a gate that
    #     quarantines must not guess. The first tests membership of `KNOWN_ITEM_TYPES`, the
    #     union of every type the corpus actually uses (census over all saved plans, 2026-08-12).
    #     Deliberately weaker than a per-subject set: it cannot tell a legal type used by the
    #     wrong stage from a legal one, but it has ZERO false positives and it catches the
    #     failure mode above exactly, because a value copied from another enumeration is never
    #     an assessment type at all. The second reports a type used only ONCE in the whole
    #     library — the "one item disagrees with every sibling" signal — as an ADVISORY.
    #
    #     A first cut derived the set from the file's own frequencies and FAILED p10 on its
    #     single legitimate ECR, quarantining a good canonical. Recorded because it is the
    #     shape of mistake this gate exists to prevent: a rare-but-legal value and an illegal
    #     one look identical to a frequency test, and only the second should ever stop a build.
    #
    # (2) AN ITEM MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK. Every schema in the corpus says the same two
    #     things in opposite directions: a non-OPEN_TASK item's stem is the stem field, and
    #     an OPEN_TASK carries it EMPTY with the prompt in `task`. Both directions are
    #     checked. `null` fails both — the schemas permit "" or [], never omitted and never
    #     null — which is the half of ARV-D-120 that could not be repaired mechanically,
    #     because a missing question has to be written.
    #
    #     THE FIELD IS NOT CALLED THE SAME THING EVERYWHERE (ARV-D-127, found at S11's C1,
    #     2026-08-12). This gate landed the same morning reading `question_text` alone, on a
    #     census that missed english: its assessment constitution names the field
    #     **`item_stem`** at all three stages, so a perfectly good english library came back
    #     with "6 without" on every file and all three canonicals were quarantined — a FALSE
    #     failure, on the first stage to meet the new gate. `item_stem_field` below is the
    #     serialization tolerance the rest of the platform already practises
    #     (`carriers.period_section_codes`, `carriers.unit_approaches`): read the names the
    #     constitutions actually use, report the one this item carries, and never assume a
    #     field name is universal because four subjects share it.
