"""Genon: annotate master_plan.json with a per-chapter CANONICAL PLAN — v2.0 (2026-08-03).

v2.0 (architecture §0) RETIRES the reverse-deduction solver, sigma, and the mandated
closing spans. The pilot proved the mandate wrong at its root (ARV-D-025): a compact's
mandated closing synthesis imported the assumption that the BORROWING plan's class had
the lending plan's own priors for those sections — jumpiness by construction. Canonicals
are now authored FREE at counts fixed by pure arithmetic (equal dispersion over
[floor, standard], master_plan.py `canonical_periods`); the ONE surviving mandate is the
standard canonical's closing whole-chapter synthesis, `section_anchor` exactly the
reserved token `synthesis`. The serve engine picks slot X from first-exposure units
(serve.py e12, §0.4) — safety comes from the RIGHT PICK, not from a mandate on the lender.

This script's two jobs:
  * annotate — write each chapter row's `canonical_plan` {counts, provisional, basis,
    registry_sections, authored} into master_plan.json (idempotent; drops any stale
    v1.x `variant_plan`). provisional=True until the standard canonical is on disk.
  * briefs — compose the standard brief (self-containment + the synthesis-anchor
    mandate) and the compact briefs (free authoring: registry discipline + total
    coverage, NO closing mandate).

Re-run after any canonical is authored/regenerated or the floor policy changes:

    WHY A BRIEF CARES (2026-08-10, S7). The standard canonical's synthesis mandate has two
    carriers for one fact (`carriers.is_synthesis`, architecture §0.3): the reserved token
    in `section_anchor`, or an explicit `"synthesis": true` on the period object. Until now
    the boolean form was reserved to the PLAN-granularity stage, on the reasoning that it
    is the one with no section axis. That was the wrong test. What decides the carrier is
    whether the FIELD exists to hold a token — and mathematics·middle has a section axis
    (its anchor is mediated from `textbook_segments[].ref`) and no field. Asking it for
    `section_anchor` would demand a field its constitution never defines, at metered STEP 1,
    and the certifier's synthesis gate would then find no synthesis unit in the library it
    had just paid for. This is the S7 analogue of S4's synthesis-handoff defect
    (`_synthesis_handoff_lines` below), and like it, it is a BRIEF matter: no constitution
    is amended (founder ruling 2026-08-10)."""

            # order"); run length and merging are Rules 1 and 2's, and the brief must not
