"""repair_c3.py v1.0 — 2026-08-09

Repairs the C3 defects that can be repaired without re-authoring, on an installed library.

Two kinds of pass, deliberately kept apart, because they scale differently:

  GENERIC passes derive the correct value from an AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE — the chapter summary,
  the Pedagogy document, the mapping JSON, the schema. They take no per-chapter input and are
  intended to run over the whole corpus at the mass pre-warm, exactly as STEP 6 does for option
  order. Adding a chapter costs nothing.

  DECLARED passes apply a hand-written table of old → new strings for one chapter. They do NOT
  generalise: a register phrasing or a word-count rewrite needs language, per instance. They are
  here so this chapter's repair is reproducible and auditable, and so the shared plumbing
  (backup · refuse-on-drift · declared repairs[] · idempotent) is written once.

Every pass refuses rather than guesses: if the value on disk matches neither the expected old
nor the already-repaired new, the file is left alone and the run reports it.

Run from the repo root:

    GENERIC list, whose contract is "derive the correct value from an AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE …
    intended to run over the whole corpus at the mass pre-warm". It is not generic. Its
    authority is MATHEMATICS' Rule 8 open-task menu, and `SUBSTITUTION_CLAUSE` says so in
    words — "any other format from the **Mathematics** open-task menu".

    Run on TWAU it proposed **nine edits across the library** (4 + 3 + 2), appending that
    sentence to OPEN_TASK guides on a stage whose Rule 8 is EXECUTABILITY BOUNDARY and which
    has no open-task menu to substitute from. That is not a no-op that happens to be

    subject's vocabulary, into a certified artefact. Found only because S5 ran this tool for
    an unrelated declared repair; at the mass pre-warm it would have reached every non-maths
    OPEN_TASK guide in the corpus.

    The other four passes are safe on TWAU by accident rather than by design, and it is worth
    recording which is which: `pass_method_label` keys on `pedagogical_method`, a field TWAU's
    schema does not have (its equivalent is the closed five-value `dominant_mode`);
    `pass_strip_internal_ids` matches `WE-N`/`E-N`, which TWAU never emits (its internal ids
    are `T-N`, and the LP already forbids them); `pass_verbatim_descriptions` reads
    `enumerated_worked_examples`/`enumerated_exercises` off the summary, which TWAU summaries
    do not carry. Only `pass_guide_shape` is genuinely subject-agnostic. **When a fifth stage

    at the textbook page the item's OWN `exercise` block already names.

    THE DEFECT (2026-08-19, S8 · W1, founder-found by reading a served plan). mathematics
    III ch 5 Q-A-1 reads *"On the dot grid below, draw a simple rangoli design…"* with
    `visual_stimulus: ""`. There is no dot grid. Detector, its four conditions and its
    subject scoping: `genon/stem_deixis.py`; the gate is C5 check 12.

    WHY THIS IS GENERIC AND NOT DECLARED, which is the whole reason it can run corpus-wide.
    The replacement is not written here — it is DERIVED from the item, in two steps that
    both read fields the item already carries:
      1. `exercise.book_ref` names the page ("Let us Do Q1, p.44");
      2. that page IS where the referent lives — the NCERT dot grid for Q1 is printed on
         p.44, which is why the item was anchored there in the first place.
    So the edit rewrites the POINTER and nothing else: `below` → `on p.44`. No judgement,
    no per-item language, no new content. Measured across the corpus, 38 of the 68 hits
    carry a usable page in their own `book_ref`.

    It is also what the constitutions already ask for. mathematics·middle Rule 9: *"the
    prompt should reference the textbook directly (e.g. 'Refer to Fig. 5.6 in §5.3 of your
    textbook')"*; english·preparatory Rule 9: *"The teacher has the book; the image lives
    there."* Prep maths states the same default in Rule 7 (`""`, figure reached through the
    `exercise` companion) — the model simply wrote the stem as though it had a figure.

    SUBJECT-GATED TO MATHEMATICS, and the gate is the point (the lesson `pass_open_task_
    substitution` records one line above). The detector only GATES on mathematics, for the
    reasons in `stem_deixis._GATES`: english's `below` is largely poem and story content
    and its referents live in spine-varying fields. An advisory finding must not be
    repaired automatically — the shortlist is ruled on at C7 by a reader.

    IT NEVER TOUCHES A T3 ITEM. Where no page is derivable the pass returns nothing and the
    item stays exactly as it is, reported by check 12 for a human. Rewriting a pointer with
    nowhere to point would replace a visible defect with an invisible one."""

    THE DEFECT. The maths·middle resynth (2026-08-19) moved the problems and their worked
    solutions OUT of teacher_notes and into a `visual_aids` table, so the Material tab
    carries them. The brief describes that table at length and never says the notes must
    POINT at it — and 36 of the 38 re-authored closers duly did not. A teacher reading the
    notes sees the sitting described and the mathematics absent, with nothing telling her
    where it went. Founder, 2026-08-20.

    WHY IT IS GENERIC. Nothing here is per-chapter: the sentence is fixed, and the only
    variable — the table's title — is read off the unit itself. That is this list's
    contract ("derive the correct value from an AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE … take no per-chapter

    It PREPENDS rather than splices, because where a sentence lands inside prose the model
    wrote is a judgement, and a pass that takes no per-chapter input has no business making
    one. First thing the teacher reads is where the problems are.

    Idempotent by inspection of the note, not by a flag: a unit whose notes already reach
    for the table in any of the observed forms is left alone. Science's polish pass settled

  # The two standards certification quarantined, each for one item, and both for the SAME
  # check — the declared-type gate that landed at this stage's own C4 with assessment v1.4
  # (ARV-D-113). This is that gate's first batch, and it is worth recording that the two
  # hits resolve in OPPOSITE directions: one stimulus is not a tick line and never was,
  # the other is a good tick line wearing labels that are too long. A single rule for
  # "number_line failures" would have got one of them wrong.
  # Both restored from backup/quarantine/ before these ran (runbook trap 1).
  # APPLIED 2026-08-19 and moved behind a 3-tuple key, which the 2-tuple lookup never
  # reaches — the same device the mathematics·ix W1/W2 sets use. Kept as the record.
  # ARV-D-187 in particular CANNOT be re-asserted even in principle: STEP 6 arranged
  # Q-C-2's options after it landed and remapped the reveals' dict keys with them
  # (B/C/D as declared -> B/A/C on disk), so the declared `new` no longer matches the
  # artefact. That is the normalizer doing its job, and it is why an applied authoring
  # entry must be retired rather than left in the live set to refuse noisily.

    # but the count is the symptom, not the defect. A tens frame is a 2×5 GRID, and
    # Rule 7 forbids a tick line from being one ("the ticks are drawn as an ordered
    # line, never as a grid"); inline SVG is prohibited at this stage, so no permitted

    # compacts whose briefs are built from its registry. THE FOUNDER SHOULD READ THIS ITEM
    # AT THE HUMAN GATE. It is the one place in the stage where text was written rather
    # than repaired, and `verified` is deliberately left FALSE: this has not been through
    # a verification pass and must not claim it has.
    #
    # THE QUESTION IS THE EXERCISE'S OWN TEST, MADE SELF-CONTAINED. "Mark the square
    # corners in these shapes" needs the p.55 figures, and Rule 7 gives this stage no way
    # to carry them (pipe-table and `number_line:` only, SVG prohibited) — so the item asks
    # about the TESTING PROCEDURE the section teaches instead of about a particular shape,
    # which is answerable from the stem alone and is the thing a child must know before the
    # book task means anything. The notebook-corner test is the section's method, not an
    # invention.

    # filler: accepting a gap, accepting an overlap, and testing along a side instead of at
    # the point where two sides meet. Each reveals a different repair, and each is stated
    # that way in `what_each_option_reveals`.
    #

    # STEP 6 arranges the options and remaps the reveals' dict KEYS with them, but it
    # cannot rewrite prose, so guide text names the ANSWER ("a square corner"), never the
    # label beside it. The reveals below are keyed to the options AS DECLARED HERE, option
    # for option; get that agreement right and any arrangement preserves it.
    #
    # `visual_stimulus` stays "" — Rule 7's stated default, with the figure reached through

  # GENERAL-PURPOSE DIAGRAM SLOT. It is the only structured visual this stage is permitted
  # (Rule 7: pipe table, `number_line:`, or nothing — inline SVG prohibited), so when the
  # model wants a sorting grid, a set of nets, a part-whole bar or a ratio pairing, the tag
  # is the nearest thing to hand. W1 saw the same pressure twice (ARV-D-185/186); at wave 2
  # it is five of five. Worth carrying into any future diagram-primitive work: the demand
  # is real and it is not for number lines.
  #
  # The remedy splits cleanly in two, and the split is the useful part:
  #   * the content IS legitimately a pipe table -> strip the tag and keep the cells, so it
  #     renders as the table it always was. A single row falls to PROSE (assessment v1.4),
  #     so these are shaped as header + one data row.

    #      L drawn on squared paper with the mirror lines marked. Rule 7 forbids a tick
    #      line from being that — "the ticks are drawn as an ordered line, never as a

The product therefore has either 9 digits (e.g., 10,00,000 × 10 = 10,00,00,000) or 10 digits (e.g., 99,99,999 × 99 = 98,99,99,901). It is always 9 or 10 digits.',

    # equivalent to what the shell was anchored on, rather than re-buying the compact.
    #
    # THE QUESTION IS BUILT ON STATEMENT (ii) OF THE BOOK EXERCISE, and asks for the
    # counterexample rather than the verdict. Three reasons, all constraints rather than
    # taste: the item's declared type is MCQ and an MCQ cannot carry the "with algebraic
    # justification" the exercise wants; all THREE statements are false in general
    # (5,10 → 7.5 · 2,4 → 3 · 5,5,5,5,10 → 6), so "which is true?" would need a
    # none-of-these option and Rule 10 bans by-label options outright; and a
    # counterexample IS the algebraic point in miniature — 5a and 5b average to
    # 5(a+b)/2, which leaves the multiples of 5 exactly when a+b is odd.
    #
    # The three distractors are the three ways to misread the task, not filler: each is a
    # pair whose average IS a multiple of 5, so choosing any of them means the student
    # looked for a pair that CONFIRMS the claim. what_each_option_reveals says so per
    # option. `goal` stays "apply", `section_ref` stays "section 5.2", the exercise block
    # is untouched, and `verified` is left false — this text has not been through a

    # refer to "the same error as A". STEP 6 then arranged the options and moved the
    # correct pair to A — it remaps the reveals DICT KEYS (normalize_options.py:180-182,

    #     {MCQ, SCR, ECR, OPEN_TASK}. The correct value is not guessed: the item's OWN

    #     `options` — the SCR shape in every particular — so the file already declares what
    #     it is, and this pass makes the label agree with it. The cause is visible in
    #     assessment Rule 3, whose guidance table puts `dominant_mode` in the LEFT column and
    #     the type in the right ("HI / CG-6 inquiry steps … | SCR"); the model emitted the left.

    # (b) `question_text: null` — A1 permits "" or [], never null, and for an SCR the stem IS
    #     the question, so as authored there was nothing to ask. THIS HALF IS AUTHORED, NOT
    #     DERIVED, and is therefore a DECLARED repair in the strictest sense: the stem below is
