# Aruvi-SaaS — Accumulated Learnings & Carry-Forward Notes

## 2026-06-27 — Planning-layer rebuild (web app restructured to the finalized flow)

### What changed
- Web app went from **3 sibling tabs** (Allocate / Generate / My Plans) to the finalized
  **two-tab, readiness-gated, hub-and-spoke** flow. Spec: `planning-layer-mockups/index.html`
  + `aruvi_saas_full_lifecycle_flow.png`. Full architecture documented in **CLAUDE.md §11**.
- New components: `Readiness.jsx` (ported from `readiness-grid-flow.html`), `GenerateTab.jsx`
  (readiness gate + folds in Allocate), `LessonView.jsx` (Learning-Unit lesson view +
  assessment artifact). Rebuilt: `MyPlans.jsx` (weekly dashboard). Reshaped: `Allocate.jsx`
  (added G2 hub `final` step, G7 `generate` spoke, G4 total-periods model, G5 howbox).
- `Generate.jsx` (old thin component) is now **dead code** — not imported; safe to delete later.

### Key decisions / carry-forwards
- **Readiness state (`ready` flag + `readiness` payload) is front-end only** — lives in
  `page.jsx`, threaded to GenerateTab/MyPlans. **Phase 4 must move it to Supabase per
  user/tenant.** Same for the LU pointer (`localStorage` key `lu_pointer_{sectionKey}`) and
  allocations (already noted below, 2026-06-22).
- **G4 weekly ratio** comes from the readiness grid (`weeklyRatioFromReadiness`) and splits the
  single total-periods input via `splitByRatio` (largest-remainder — unit-tested, always sums
  exactly). Falls back to period-rows when readiness data absent. Internally still writes into
  `rows` so the engine allocate call + persist + export path is unchanged.
- **Status belongs in My Plans, not Generate** (deliberate): started/in-progress/locked is
  execution state (the LU pointer); Generate only knows allocated vs. plan-made.
- **G7 generate spoke serves saved-plan previews** — live generation still deferred.

### Verification limitation (important, recurring)
- **The Cowork sandbox cannot run `next dev`/`next build`** — Next.js's arm64 SWC native
  binary fails to load, and the Google-Fonts `@import` stalls the build. So all web work this
  session was verified **statically only** (brace/export/prop-contract greps, CSS brace
  balance, unit-testing pure helpers). **None of Phases 1/2/3/5 has been live-rendered.**
  A local smoke test of the whole loop at desktop + mobile is the must-do before more UI work:
  `export ARUVI_DATA_DIR="../Project Aruvi/app/mirror"; python3 -m uvicorn api.main:app
  --port 8000; npm --prefix web run dev`.

### Deferred / parked
- **G6 selective-reset screen** not yet aligned to the mockup (still the old modal, not the
  G2-styled select-to-clear danger-zone screen).
- **Sample-plans pre-readiness surface** parked — it exposes only an LP, not the execution/
  My-Plans value; needs a better approach (mockups Screen S note).

### Allocations persistence (accumulation model)
- **What was built:** The Allocate tab now accumulates allocations — when a teacher allocates a second set of chapters, both sets persist in the Final view, not just the latest one.
- **Current scope:** In-memory during the session (state-based). Survives page navigation but resets on browser refresh.
- **Portability note:** When moving to Supabase, allocations must be persisted to the DB keyed by (subject, grade, user/teacher_id). Each allocation set should be a row with (chapter_numbers[], period_rows[], final_allocation_data). The UI `allAllocations` array becomes a DB query + cache in the API layer.
- **Migration path:** Add a `POST /subjects/{subject}/{grade}/save-allocation` endpoint in the FastAPI layer (api/main.py) that writes to Supabase. The web component calls it instead of just updating local state. Keep the in-memory `allAllocations` as a display cache during the session.

### Text updates (2026-06-22)
- Changed "AI Suggested Allocation" → "Suggested allocation" (line 248, Allocate.jsx)
- Changed period-definition subtitle to "To begin, set the total number of periods available and how long each period type lasts below." (line 370, Allocate.jsx)
