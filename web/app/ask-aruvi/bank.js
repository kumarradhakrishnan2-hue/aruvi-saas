/* ───────── Ask Aruvi — the question bank, fetched once and kept on the device ─────────
 *
 * ★ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-08-30). The bank used to be a static import inside
 * AskAruvi.jsx, which compiled all 120 answers into the main page chunk. That chunk is a
 * PUBLIC url served before anyone signs in, so the bank — which states how period
 * allocation is weighted and how each subject's assessment is built — was downloadable by
 * any crawler or competitor, in machine-readable form, without an account.
 *
 * ★ THE TWO REQUIREMENTS PULL OPPOSITE WAYS, and this file is how both are met:
 *
 *   1. SIGNED-IN ONLY. GET /ask-aruvi sits behind X-Aruvi-User. Nothing ships in the
 *      bundle any more, so there is nothing to read without an account. (The trial is
 *      free, so this is a fence, not a wall — the point is that it stops being PUBLIC.)
 *
 *   2. STILL WORKS OFFLINE. Ask Aruvi is the HELP screen; it is needed exactly when the
 *      network is poor, on a school Android, mid-corridor. So the bank is fetched ONCE and
 *      written to localStorage, and every read after that is local and synchronous.
 *
 * ★ THE ETAG IS WHAT MAKES THE FRESHNESS CHECK FREE. We store the server's ETag beside the
 * bank and send it back as If-None-Match. On a normal app load the server answers 304 with
 * no body — a few hundred bytes — and we keep what we have. The ~90KB download happens only
 * in the month the answers actually change. So: a check every load, a download almost never.
 *
 * ★ FAILURE IS ALWAYS SILENT AND ALWAYS FALLS BACK TO THE STORED COPY. Offline, a dead
 * server, a 401 — none of them may blank the help screen. The only state with no answers is
 * a teacher whose first session lost signal before the priming fetch landed, and page.jsx
 * primes at sign-in (when she has just authenticated over the network) to make that rare.
