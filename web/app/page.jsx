/* ───────── app shell ─────────
 * The app is gated behind a user-ID portal (Login). No password yet: the entered ID is the
 * tenant key — stored in localStorage, sent as X-Aruvi-User on every API call, and used by
 * the server to scope all per-teacher state (tenant_id == user_id). This makes the
 * persistence testable across multiple "teachers" and is the exact seam Phase 4 swaps for
 * Supabase Auth.
 *
 * Nav (2026-07-02 restructure): TWO CENTRE TABS — "My Classes" (home: one card per section,
 * pointer-organized) and "My Lessons" (the plan repository). No sidebar, no hamburger, no
 * Calendar, no My Week — Aruvi organizes by the section pointer ("where did I stop?"), never
 * by days (see MEMORY.md 2026-07-02). The teaching profile is parked behind the header's
 * settings gear. Generate is not a tab — it's reached only through "+ Prepare Lesson".
 * Readiness is PERSISTED server-side per user (GET/POST /readiness): the teaching profile
 * (subjects/grades/sections/durations) is loaded when a user signs in, so it survives a
 * refresh, a server restart, or a fresh browser — never lost on session cut. */
/* Activation gate (Phase 1, §0): the shell stays hidden until the teacher has completed the
 * guided first run. This USED to be tracked as a separate localStorage flag per user — but
 * that flag was purely client-side and could desync from the server: e.g. deleting a test
 * user's profile/allocations server-side left the browser's stale "activated" flag in place,
 * so she'd skip straight to a now-empty shell instead of being sent back through FirstRun
 * (found testing kumar3, 2026-07-02). Fixed by dropping the separate flag entirely — `ready`
 * (rehydrated from the real GET /readiness response) is now the SOLE activation signal, since
 * FirstRun's finishActivation always produces a real subjects[] payload before calling
 * onComplete. One source of truth, server-side, never stale. */

     ★ AMENDED 2026-08-27 (founder) — it is the SAME WINDOW as the "+" portal, and it has a
     SECOND moment. Two changes, one idea:
       (a) the prompt no longer offers a lone "open my teaching profile" row. It renders
           ProfilePortal in "check" mode: identical rows to the "+" window (subject · class ·
           section · periods a week · the year's total), only the title, the sub-line and the
           closing button differ. A window that names what Aruvi assumed and then hands her a
           generic link to go find it was doing half the job.
       (b) it also fires when a SUBSCRIBER who has added a subject or a class first opens that
           subject·class in My Lessons. Aruvi makes the very same assumptions for an added
           subject as it made for her first one, so she deserves the very same question about it
           — asked at first USE, not at the moment she adds it (that is one more configuration
           screen stacked on the one she is standing on; §0's benefit-first rule).
     State is now a descriptor, not a boolean, and it holds BOTH moods of the one window:
       { mode:"change" }                                — she pulled the "+" on My Classes
       { mode:"check", reason:"tour" }                  — the tour just ended
       { mode:"check", reason:"added", subject, grade } — first use of a subject·class she added
     page.jsx owns it for both (the "+" state used to live inside MyPlans) because the window has
     to survive a trip into the profile and come back — see goPortalHome. MyPlans still gets the

     The distinction that makes this different from a portal row: the "+"/check window's budget

     ALWAYS SCOPED, and that is the whole point: Year Plan is already standing in one
     subject·class, so both pick screens ("In which subject?" / "Which class?") would be asking
     a question the screen has already answered. `win: null` because she came from a page, not
     a window — goPortalHome then restores only the tab.

     your set-up?" — and four bare nouns cannot be checked. She had to open each row to discover
     what Aruvi had chosen, which is four round trips to answer one glance-sized question.

     ROWS note: five of them turned a glanceable list into a page and pushed the last row below
     the fold at 360px). A VALUE is different — it is short, and it sits right-aligned on the
     SAME line, before the chevron. Zero added height, so that decision stands untouched.

     ★ CHECK MOOD ONLY. The "+" window is unscoped by nature — it is the whole profile — so a
     teacher with three subjects would see "6, 7, 8" or a blank against Class, which is noise on
     a row she is using to navigate. In check mood the scope is always known: the tour ending is
     her single set-up, and the added-a-subject window is filtered to one subject·stage.

     Returns null when there is nothing safe to say — a missing value renders NOTHING rather than

              tab row could stay frozen while the Aruvi row scrolled away behind it. Both rows
              are now STATIC inside this one wrapper; they can only move as a unit.
          (b) the wrapper was then `position: sticky`, and on an iPhone home-screen (standalone)
              web app it still scrolled away — the brand row simply left with the content and
              came back on returning to the top, i.e. sticky was not taking effect at all for a
              direct child of <body> in that webview. It was made `position: fixed` + spacer —
              and the webview scrolled THAT away too.
          (c) so scroll ownership moved off the document entirely (2026-08-09): when the shell
              is up, html.app-shell (globals.css) locks html/body and .bodycontent is the one
              scroll container — this bar is plain static flow and cannot move. The fixed rule
