/* ── The Privacy Notice, on screen (2026-09-04) ──
 *
 * GIVEN, NOT SIGNED. DPDP §5 makes a privacy notice something Meyy GIVES at or before
 * it collects anything; consent (§6) is a separate act, asked for only where consent is
 * the basis — the agreement's optional marketing tick. So this component has no
 * checkbox and records nothing: it renders the document, whole, wherever it is opened —
 *
 *   · the sign-in screen, BEFORE she types her mobile (Login.jsx) — the moment of first
 *     collection, which is where the law wants the notice; no account exists yet, so
 *     GET /legal/privacy takes no X-Aruvi-User;
 *   · the agreement's final tick, whose own words are "…and Privacy Notice" — the words
 *     are a link that opens this in a sheet over the wizard (Agreement.jsx);
 *   · Settings › Legal, permanently, beside the agreement (Settings.jsx).
 *
 * The version she was shown is stamped on her ACCOUNT by the server (at registration
 * and when she dismisses the "updated" note), never by this component: the record must
 * name the version that was current on the server at that moment, not what a client
 * believed. It is erased with her — it is a fact about the record, not a consent.
 *
 * THE TEXT IS NEVER TYPED HERE. It is the founder's markdown, front matter dropped,
 * from the content store (api/legal.py) — one copy, versioned by filename, never edited
 * once shown. `version` shows an older published version when a caller wants the one
 * her record names. */
/* `frame` (founder, 2026-09-04: "freeze it from top down to … Privacy Notice"): the
 * pre-sign-in screen is a THREE-BAND FRAME like the agreement's sign step — title pinned,
 * document scrolling, Back pinned — so a teacher scrolling a long document never loses
 * either what she is reading or the way out. The container must stop growing for that
 * to work (`.ob-wrap-lock` / `.ob-body-lock`, applied by the caller — a component cannot
 * reach its own container); here the class is `lgl-frame`, which shares the sign
 * frame's CSS without implying a signature. Read mode in Settings ignores it. */
