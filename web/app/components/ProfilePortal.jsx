/* ───────── ProfilePortal — ONE window for "what did Aruvi assume, and what do I want to change?"
 * (founder, 2026-08-27) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There used to be TWO windows on My Classes doing one job:
 *   • the standing "+" grow portal — "What would you like to change?" — Subject · Class · Section;
 *   • the once-per-tour "Would you like to check your set-up?" prompt, which offered a single row
 *     into the profile accordion.
 * They were the same question asked at two moments, and the check prompt was the weaker of the
 * two: it named the thing (sections, periods, the year's total) and then handed her a generic
 * "open my teaching profile" link to go find it. So the check prompt is now the SAME window,
 * wearing its own title. Only the title and the sub-line differ — the rows are identical,
 * because the rows are the answer in both moods.
 *
 * ★ FOUR rows — class · section · periods a week · annual budget (founder, 2026-08-27, arrived
 * at over the day). First run asks THREE things (subject · class · chapter) and ASSUMES the
 * rest on her behalf: the section, the periods-per-week, and the calibrated annual budget Year
 * Plan is then built on — so a window offering only the structural levels cannot answer "did
 * Aruvi get my set-up right?". Periods a week and the annual budget each route into the SAME
 * editNums screens the profile's pencils use (portalIntent "ppw" | "budget"). Subject was the
 * fifth and is gone — see the ROWS note below.
 *
 * ★ EACH ROW CHANGES ONLY ITSELF. No row runs downstream into the next level's questions: the
 * class row adds a class with first run's own defaults (Section A, default length, default
 * periods, auto budget) and stops. Anything else she wants set, she sets from the row that
 * names it — which is why the window comes back after every visit.
 *
 * ★ AND A WAY OUT TO THE WHOLE PROFILE (founder, same day). The rows are each a spot edit;
 * the footer is the panorama — "want to see your full teaching profile?" — because a teacher
 * checking her set-up may want to READ it all at once and be reassured, not amend one field.
 * It opens the profile under Settings, where she can amend directly too.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   "change" — she pulled the "+".
 *   "check"  — Aruvi is asking, at one of two moments (see the pending helpers below). Carries a
 *              caller-supplied `sub` line saying WHAT was assumed.
 * Neither has a closing button: the ✕ is the exit, and nothing here is a gate.
 */

/* ★ NAMES ONLY, no explanatory line under each (founder, 2026-08-27). The rows carried a
   sub-line apiece ("Add or remove a class in a subject") and five of them turned a glanceable
   list into a page — on a 360px phone the last row fell below the fold. They are the words the
   profile itself uses; a teacher standing in this window already knows what a Section is.
   One line each, the chevron on the right. */
/* ★ NO "Subject" ROW — IN EITHER MOOD (founder, 2026-08-27, in two steps). It went from the
   CHECK window first: that window asks "did Aruvi get this right?", and the subject is the one
   thing on the list Aruvi never guessed — she BOUGHT it (billing unit = teacher × subject-stage)
   or she just added it, which is what raised the window. Then from the "+" window too, for a
   blunter reason: **she cannot add a subject here anyway** (a new subject is a purchase, so it
   arrives through the subscribe flow), which leaves REMOVAL as the row's only working half — the
   most destructive act in the profile, one tap from a window she opened to add a section. The
   subject-level dustbin still exists, in Settings › teaching profile, behind the master EDIT
   toggle and its scoped warning. That is far enough away. */

/* ── The "she just added something" queue ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The check window has TWO moments. The first is the end of the guided tour (page.jsx's
 * finishTour) — her very first set-up, all of it assumed. The second is this one: a subscriber
 * ADDS a subject or a class, and Aruvi again assumes a section, a periods-per-week and a year's
 * total for it. She should be asked the same question about the new one — but NOT at the moment
 * she adds it (that is the profile screen she is already standing on, and §0's benefit-first rule
 * says do not stack configuration on configuration). She is asked the first time she actually
 * USES it: when My Lessons scopes to that subject·class.
 *
 * So an add writes a key here and My Lessons spends it. Per user (a shared browser must never
 * hand one teacher another's queue) and per subject·class, since a new CLASS in an existing
 * subject carries exactly the same assumptions as a new subject does.
 * localStorage, not the server: it is a prompt, not a record — losing it costs one question.
