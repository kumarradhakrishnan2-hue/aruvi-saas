/* ───────── FirstRun — shell-less Guided First Experience (Phase 1, 2026-07-01) ─────────
 * The mobile-first, progressive-acquisition entry point (CLAUDE.md §0). Until the teacher has
 * generated one lesson and attached it to a section, there is NO app shell — no header, no
 * tabs, no sidebar. She just completes one meaningful task. This component owns that whole
 * pre-activation surface and renders full-screen on its own.
 *
 * Principle: benefit first, data second. We ask ONE subject, ONE grade, ONE chapter — the
 * minimum to generate a first lesson — with the CALIBRATED defaults pre-filled (2026-07-26:
 * the class's standard duration and the master plan's period count for that chapter; the old
 * flat 40 min / 12 periods is now only a fallback) and
 * only revealed for editing if the teacher taps "Want to change?". Each answer quietly becomes
 * part of the profile later; she never feels she is "building a profile."
 *
 * Steps: welcome → subject → grade → chapter (+duration). That is ALL of it. The chapter CTA
 * fires the serve and hands off immediately; page.jsx opens the shell on MY LESSONS, where the
 * ordinary preparing card shows the progress bar and is replaced in place by the real lesson,
 * with the tour offer beneath it. There is NO "Lesson plan ready!" screen and no creatingCards
 * beat — first run has no waiting screen of its own, because the shell already has one.
 *
 * ★ THREE STEPS, AND ONLY THREE (founder, 2026-08-21). Between the preview and the handoff there
 * used to be FOUR more screens — sections → periods/week → durations → annual budget — demanded
 * at the moment of her first success, in a flow whose own rail promises Subject · Class · Chapter.
 * All four are gone. Sections are STATED on the Class step ("we'll start you with Section 9A",
 * changeable in the profile); duration was already asked on the chapter step and was a straight
 * duplicate; periods/week and annual budget are seeded with the defaults those screens opened on
 * and are met later in the profile and Year Plan, where they first mean something. She lands on
 * My Lessons rather than My Classes because the promise was a lesson plan, not an empty card.
 *
 * ★ THE CARD LANDS ATTACHED (founder, 2026-08-21) — this REVERSES the 2026-07-05 "cards land
 * UNATTACHED" rule for first run. That rule existed because auto-binding made the first class
 * look finished while the profile behind it had never been built; the profile IS built now
 * (subject · class · section · duration · calibrated budget), so the reason has expired, and
 * what the rule left behind was an empty card at the end of a flow whose whole promise was a
 * lesson. `prepareAndHandOff` binds the plan to the default section the moment it lands. The
 * tour still TEACHES attaching — its orchestration forces the card unbound at steps ≤9 and
 * re-binds at 10 — so the demo is unaffected by starting from a bound card.
 *
 * NO DAY SCHEDULE (2026-07-02): the weekly-arrangement step is GONE. Aruvi organizes by the
 * section pointer ("where did I stop?"), not by days — the calendar was a category error
 * against that model (see MEMORY.md 2026-07-02). First run never asks which days she teaches;
 * the canonical payload still carries a grids[] field for shape-compat, but it is always
 * all -1 ("no schedule"). Design: warm-paper system (§4), authored mobile-first.
 *
 * The preview step deliberately does NOT render the full lesson plan (ViewModelView) — a saved
 * plan currently stands in for it, and a REAL generated plan will later live in the exact same
 * saved-plans folder, but either way showing the whole document before she's attached it to a
 * class works against the guided flow. Instead it shows a teaser of common fields (subject,
 * class, chapter title, period count, assessment item count) pulled from that plan's view model.
 *
 * Props:
 *   user        — signed-in id (for the greeting line, optional)
 *   onComplete(payload) — payload = { subjects: [subjectRecord] }, the CANONICAL readiness
 *     shape (same one Readiness.jsx's buildPayload()/onReadyComplete produce) built from
 *     everything the teacher picked: subject, grade, one section-per-fan-out. The grids[]
 *     field ships all -1 (day schedules are never collected). The caller (page.jsx) persists
 *     it via POST /readiness and flips ready — that's the real activation moment, not a flag.
 *   onExit()    — optional: back out to sign-in (from the welcome step)

// ── The calibrated standard (founder, 2026-07-26) ──
// Both defaults on the chapter step now come from OUR calibrated master plan
// (data/content/allocation_norms/master_plan.json), served by GET /subjects/{s}/{g}/chapters
// as `standard_duration_minutes` (class-banded: 40 for ≤VII, 45 for VIII, 50 for IX–X) and
// per-chapter `recommended_periods` (share of the calibrated annual budget by effort weight).
// That is the same basis the certified canonicals were authored at — SS IX ch 5 is 21×50 —
// so the first lesson she is about to generate and the default she is shown finally agree.
// Before this, first run seeded a flat 12 × 40 min for every chapter of every class, which
// contradicted the canonical by a wide margin (480 min vs 1050 min on that chapter).
