/* ───────── YearPlan — the whole teaching year for ONE subject·class, at a glance ─────────
 * This is the restructured "allocation report" (founder decision, 2026-07-21): a LIVING mobile
 * view, never a PDF. It answers the one question My Lessons' per-chapter cards can't — "across
 * all my chapters and my finite annual periods, how does the year shape up, and how much have I
 * committed so far?" It reaches the teacher as the "Year Plan" pane of the My Lessons toggle, so
 * it inherits that tab's Subject·Class scope (this artifact is a class-level thing; it never sits
 * inside a chapter and there's nowhere else it belongs).
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT show (the whole point of the restructure):
 *   • no competencies / competency weightages — those now live in the LP at chapter level;
 *   • no effort-index VALUES — an internal calibration signal, meaningless to a teacher. The
 *     index's information survives only as its consequence: raw periods (9 for Force vs 7 for
 *     Optics = "Force needs more time"), which is the value she can actually use.
 *
 * Two period figures, side by side:
 *   • Suggested — Aruvi's proposal: her annual budget distributed across chapters by the same
 *     effort/competency weight the allocator uses (largest-remainder, whole periods, sums to
 *     budget). Computed client-side so it always reconciles to the budget with no extra call.
 *   • Your plan — the periods she actually set when she prepared each lesson (prepared_periods
 *     from /plans). A class-level COMMITMENT, not classroom execution — so it stays honest and
 *     needs zero new input from her, and there is deliberately no "actual taught" column (that
 *     lives per-section on My Classes and Aruvi does not supervise it).
 *
 * The budget ledger (budget / committed / left) is the "must return" hook: pure arithmetic of her
 * own choices, updated whenever she prepares a lesson — reflection, never a verdict on her pace.
 *
 * Data: GET /subjects/{s}/{g}/chapters → {chapters:[{chapter_number,chapter_title,weight,
 * recommended_periods, recommended_source, ncf_estimated_periods}], standard_duration_minutes,
 * annual_budget_periods, allocation_basis}; GET /plans/{s}/{g} → prepared + prepared_periods
 * per chapter; budget from readiness via annualBudgetPeriods().
 *
 * NOTE — duration combos (40m/60m split per chapter) are not shown yet: prepared_periods stores
 * a single total, so a per-chapter by-duration breakdown isn't available on the committed side.
 * Reinstating it is a fast-follow that needs markPrepared to persist periods_by_duration.
 *
 * Props: subjectName (display), sSlug, gSlug (slugs), readiness (page projection), onAllocate.
