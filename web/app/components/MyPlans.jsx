   been written against an earlier constitution or textbook edition and she must never be
   uncertain which version is in her hand. Rendered from either source: the year the

          words mean nothing to her; after it they mean something.
          Declining is a real answer and is therefore the primary button: her set-up already
          works, the lesson is attached, and nothing here is a gate. */}
