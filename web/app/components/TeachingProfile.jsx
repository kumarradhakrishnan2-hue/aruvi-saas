/* ───────── TeachingProfile — Settings → "Your teaching profile" (rebuilt 2026-07-02) ─────────
 * The ONE profile editor, reached through the header settings gear.
 *
 * Founder spec (this iteration):
 *   • ACCORDION — subjects are collapsible rows; ONLY ONE subject (and its classes) is open
 *     at a time, so the page never shows more than one subject's tree. Tap a header to open.
 *   • MASTER EDIT — a single Edit toggle reveals ALL mutation controls at once: red dustbins
 *     (delete a subject / a class / a section chip), "edit →" on the numbers line, and the
 *     green add buttons (+ section · + add a class · + add a subject). View mode is clean —
 *     nothing but her data.
 *   • STRUCTURE vs VALUES — things in her tree (subjects/classes/sections) are added/removed
 *     in place; numbers about a thing (duration · periods/week · annual budget) open the same
 *     single-question wheel screens from day one, prefilled, Save and back. One editing idiom.
 *   • NO whole-profile actions — "Delete profile" and "Redo whole profile" are gone. The
 *     profile is only ever edited at a point.
 *
 * Every dustbin gets ONE scoped confirm naming exactly what goes (a section names one card;
 * a class names its sections; a subject names its classes) and always ends with: lessons stay
 * in the library. Removals cascade upward (last section takes its class; last class takes its
 * subject) and clear the removed sections' local state (lu_pointer_*, current_chapter_*).
 *
 * Adding a subject runs that ONE subject through the conversational loop (classes → per class:
 * sections → duration → periods/week → the 4-method annual-budget estimator), with the
 * "subject saved ✓ — continue / finish for now" checkpoint between subjects when several are
 * added at once. Adding a class runs ONLY the new class(es) through the per-class questions —
 * existing classes are never re-asked. All time-facts remain NUMBERS (no day schedule, ever —
 * the calendar purge, MEMORY.md 2026-07-02); grids[] ships all -1 for shape-compat.
 *
 * Props: readiness (projection carrying canonical .subjects[]), onChange(projection).

 * There used to be four: "I know my teaching weeks" | "my period count" | "my working days" |
 * "estimate it". They were four ways to CONSTRUCT a number, and they existed because Aruvi
 * could not tell her what her year should be. The calibrated master plan ended that: Aruvi
 * knows (245 for social_sciences·ix). She is no longer building a budget from raw materials,
 * she is DISAGREEING with one — "I say 245, you say 215" — and that needs one input, not four.
 *
 * They also actively manufactured inconsistency. Three of the four multiplied by periods-a-week,
 * so a wrong ppw corrupted the money; and the founder's own worked example: at 7 a week, "200
 * periods" implies 28.6 teaching weeks, "170 working days" implies 24, "220" implies 31 — three
 * inputs describing one year with nothing reconciling them. Worse, `setMethod` REPLACED the
 * value with a fresh default instead of converting it, so a first-run teacher sitting on a
 * calibrated 245 who merely tapped "weeks" silently got 6 × 30 = 180 — the 19→14 defect of
 * 2026-08-21 (CLAUDE.md) reachable through a second door.
 *
 * Collapsing also removes a circular definition: with `weeks`/`days`/`auto` gone from the
 * WRITER, budget never derives from ppw, so ppw can be derived from the standard without the
 * two defining each other.
 *
 * ★ THE READER BELOW STILL UNDERSTANDS ALL FOUR, and must keep doing so. Teachers have saved
 * weeks/days/auto records; retiring the writer is safe, retiring the reader would silently move
 * their years. Nothing new is ever written in those shapes.

   it evaluates to, and saves it back as `periods`. So a teacher who once answered in weeks
   sees the same year she has always had, and it simply stops being expressed as a multiplier.
   That is the conversion `setMethod` never did: it replaced the value with a fresh default,
   which is how a calibrated 245 silently became 180.

     every such class silently landed on 180 while Aruvi's own answer for it was 245.
     `budgetPeriods` must keep resolving it to a number (Year Plan and the class cards have to
