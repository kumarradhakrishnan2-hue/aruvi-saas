/* ── Settings › Support (2026-08-27) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * EMAIL IS THE ONLY SUPPORT CHANNEL. No phone, no WhatsApp, no chat. That single
 * constraint shapes every decision on this screen, because email's one failure mode is
 * SILENCE — a teacher who writes and hears nothing writes again, or gives up on the
 * product rather than on the message.
 *
 *   1. DEFLECT BEFORE INVITING. Ask Aruvi sits above the form, not below it. It answers
 *      "how does this work?" instantly; without that door first, the slowest channel in
 *      the product becomes its FAQ, and she waits two days for something she could have
 *      had in four seconds.
 *   2. THE FORM IS NOT A `mailto:`. A mailto: assumes a configured mail client — on a
 *      budget Android with only the Gmail web view, it is a dead link — and it leaves
 *      Aruvi with no record, no reference, and no way to attach what the app already
 *      knows. It posts to /support instead.
 *   3. A CATEGORY, NOT A SUBJECT LINE. A dropdown (founder, 2026-08-27 — chips first,
 *      then this: five labels as chips wrapped to three rows on a phone and pushed the
 *      message box below the fold, which is the one thing that must be visible). She
 *      does not have to compose a title for her own problem, and billing can carry its
 *      own faster promise. "Something else" is the last option deliberately — a list
 *      with no escape hatch gets the nearest wrong bucket picked instead.
 *   4. THE PROMISE IS STATED ONCE, AFTER SENDING, AND IT COMES FROM THE SERVER.
 *      "Within 2 working days" is the value POST /support returns, the same one the
 *      acknowledgement quotes. A stated window beats a fast unstated one: the anxiety is
 *      not the wait, it is not knowing there is an end to it — but the moment that
 *      matters is when she is actually waiting, i.e. after the send. It was stated twice
 *      until 2026-09-04 (once above the button, once on "Message sent", in the same
 *      words), and a promise repeated verbatim two screens apart reads as two promises.
 *   5. THE CONFIRMATION IS A REFERENCE. Not "thanks, we'll be in touch" — a case
 *      number, on screen and in her inbox, which is what turns a message into something
 *      somebody owes an answer on.
 *
 * What this screen deliberately does NOT do: apologise on behalf of an answer nobody
 * has written yet, promise an outcome, or list channels that do not exist. */
