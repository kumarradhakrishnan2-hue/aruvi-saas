/* ── The subscribe wizard: About you → Agreement → Subjects & stages → Pay ──
 *
 * ★ THE AGREEMENT STEP (founder, 2026-08-27) sits BEFORE the subject/stage cart, not
 * before Pay. The five acknowledgements say what Aruvi IS — a teaching aid, not
 * endorsed by any board, no student data, AI-assisted, personally licensed — and she
 * should have those five facts before she picks what to buy. Placed after the cart it
 * would arrive as an obstacle between her and a purchase she had already assembled.
 * Component: Agreement.jsx (shared with Settings › Legal). Re-consent is per DOCUMENT
 * VERSION, resolved server-side, so a subscriber adding a subject walks straight past.
 *
 * ONE implementation, two doors (founder, 2026-08-25):
 *   · the FRONT DOOR — Login's subscribe path, entered after OTP verification;
 *   · IN-APP — the trial-exhausted paywall's Subscribe button, for a teacher who is
 *     already signed in (her mobile already verified), landing at About you with the
 *     rail showing Verify done.
 *
 * Props: userId (the mobile/id the checkout runs as — the X-Aruvi-User header),
 * chrome (optional bar element rendered on top; Login passes its Bar, the in-app
 * overlay passes none), onDone(userId) after activation, onCancel for backing out of
 * the first step, onTrial (see below). Pay is the HONEST STUB (no fake gateway;
 * activates instantly via the server's dev checkout and says so).
 *
 * ★ THE TRIAL OFFER — FRONT DOOR ONLY (founder, 2026-08-27). A teacher who chose
 * Subscribe on the very first screen has committed to money before she has seen a
 * single lesson, so the wizard raises a Trial / Subscribe choice. Subscribe walks on
 * exactly as before. Trial calls `onTrial()` — Login signs her straight in, the same
 * path its own Free-to-try card takes. The offer exists ONLY when the caller passes
 * `onTrial`: the IN-APP door (paywall / Settings) belongs to a teacher whose trial has
 * ended or lapsed, and offering her a trial there would be an offer Aruvi cannot
 * honour. Do not make this unconditional.
 *
 * ★ MOVED TO THE VERY FRONT — after Verify, BEFORE About-you (founder, 2026-08-27).
 * It first fired on the CART's Continue, then before the Agreement; both were too late
 * for the same reason, and the second move made the reason plain. A teacher who takes
 * the trial and decides Aruvi is not for her should not have typed her name, email,
 * role, state and school first — that is a profile built for a purchase that never
 * happens. Everything the wizard collects is only needed by someone who is buying, so
 * the fork belongs before the first field. The trial is an OFFER, never a gate: she may
 * decline it and subscribe straight away, which is why this is a modal with two live
 * choices and not a step in the rail. It fires on MOUNT, once per session
 * (`offeredRef`), and the modal renders on every screen it can still be open over. */
